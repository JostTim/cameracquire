Implement a WebSocket for video streaming (more reliable):


WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection between a client and a server. This is useful for applications that require real-time data updates, such as live video streaming, chat applications, or online gaming.

To implement WebSockets in your application, we can use a library like Flask-SocketIO for the server side and the native WebSocket API in JavaScript for the client side. Here's a basic example of how we might set this up:

Server-Side (Flask with Flask-SocketIO)
Install Flask-SocketIO:

``npm add flask-socketio``

Set up the Flask application with WebSocket support:

```Python
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@socketio.on('connect')
def handle_connect():
    print('Client connected')
    # You can start sending frames here
    # emit('frame', {'data': 'frame data'})

@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    print('Client disconnected')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, debug=True)

```

Client-Side (JavaScript)
Include the Socket.IO client library in your HTML:


```Html
<script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.0.0/socket.io.min.js"></script>
Set up the WebSocket connection:

Tsx
Insert code

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const socket = io();

    socket.on('connect', function() {
        console.log('Connected to server');
    });

    socket.on('frame', function(data) {
        // Handle incoming frame data
        console.log('Received frame:', data);
        // Update the image source or handle the frame data as needed
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', function() {
        console.log('Disconnected from server');
    });
});
```


Explanation
Server-Side: The Flask application uses Flask-SocketIO to handle WebSocket connections. When a client connects, we can start emitting frames or other data to the client.

Client-Side: The JavaScript code establishes a WebSocket connection to the server using the Socket.IO client library. It listens for events like connect, frame, and disconnect to handle the connection lifecycle and incoming data.

This setup allows us to send real-time data from the server to the client efficiently. We can modify the emit calls to send actual video frames or other data as needed for your application.
